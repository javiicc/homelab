      #Â This patch helps add the secret reference to the 
      # kube-proxy DaemonSet previously created by kubeadm.
      # The kube-apiserver secret contains the kube-apiserver
      # URL, just to avoid publishing it in a public repository.
      # Once the secret is loaded in an environment variable, it can 
      # be injected into the the configMap.
